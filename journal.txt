2015-07-16 19:24 Hello, os!

2015-07-16 19:35 Return to OS development after a long break, trying to recall all the sources
and tutorials I was using.

Entry point is wiki.osdev.org category Level 1
<http://wiki.osdev.org/Category:Level_1_Tutorials>

Basically at this moment it's just 2 tutorials:

* Bare bones <http://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones>
* Meaty skeleton <http://wiki.osdev.org/Meaty_Skeleton>

2015-07-16 19:53 Let's try to build another bare bones version with help of
<http://littleosbook.github.io/>.

This tutorial is kinda more consistent and modern. What tempts me is using of
NASM in it though osdev wiki has one too
<http://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones_with_NASM>

Also it actively uses Bochs which I failed to employ while doing osdev
BareBones. 

Lets give it a try.
