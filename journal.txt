2015-07-16 19:35 Return to OS development after a long break, trying to recall all the sources
and tutorials I was using.

Entry point is wiki.osdev.org category Level 1
<http://wiki.osdev.org/Category:Level_1_Tutorials>

Basically at this moment it's just 2 tutorials:

* Bare bones <http://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones>
* Meaty skeleton <http://wiki.osdev.org/Meaty_Skeleton>
